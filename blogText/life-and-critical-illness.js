<p>Life insurance is a social contract where the unfortunate few are supported by the fortunate many. Its &lsquo;magic dollars&rsquo; paid due to the fact your premiums paid into his <strong>pool of money</strong>, collected by an insurance company from other citizens like yourself, will pay future income you have not earned yet, in the event of death of disability.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Whole Life</strong> &ndash; (Cash Value life insurance to age 100 years)</p>
<p>This cash value life insurance plan is permanent coverage which provides security for a lifetime. The cash value built up in the plan enables you to have access to a loan facility where you can borrow against its increasing value over time in force. You can also use the cash value as collateral for future loans if you choose. Upon your untimely passing, your beneficiaries receive the sum insured (insured value minus any loans).&nbsp;For example, if you are insured for $1,000,000 and have a loan of $20,000 outstanding on the policy balance this is what will be paid, $1,000,000 - $20,000 = $980,000.</p>
<p>This $980,000 is paid to your named beneficiary or estate, if no one is named. Its always better to named beneficiaries to avoid probate/legal fees to determine who is entitled to your belongings (estate). Once premiums are up to date, life insurance guarantees that once you aren&rsquo;t around to provide food, education tuition and books, extra-curricular activities, shelter, entertainment and transport etc, the money left behind through life insurance delivers needed comfort while your family is mourning your loss. Dreams and aspirations you have for the family can continue.</p>
<p><strong>Cash value benefits can be use for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Emergency expenses</li>
<li>Down payment for your dream home or paying off a mortgage,</li>
<li>Your dream get away (vacation)</li>
<li>Loan collateral while you are alive</li>
<li>Cover funeral bills, executor and probate fees</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Term to 85 yrs (Temporary Life Coverage)</strong></p>
<p>Term life is like renting insurance for a period of time e.g. 10, 20, term to 65, 85 yrs. It is designed to afford you the temporary life coverage you need in the event of your untimely passing &ndash; dying too soon. It is cheaper, more affordable coverage than whole life or universal life (unit linked) insurance, both of which are cash value builders. Term life is best suited for mortgages or business coverage. Term coverage gives the added assurance debts and income replacement needs are met. It can be converted to cash value at any time during the life of the policy, once in force at the time of conversion.</p>
<p><strong><em>Key Person Insurance</em></strong> is an example of funding with Term life coverage. Its affordability and flexibility affords a business owner/s the peace of mind that upon the event of his/her passing or permanent disability monies are transfered to the company. This money pays for business overheads, inventory or buyout business interest (stake or shares), the surviving partner/s can now continue to operate without contention. A legal agreement must exist for this to be properly executed and avoid legal wrangling.</p>
<p>The insurance funds the Buy Out agreement.</p>
