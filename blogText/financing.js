    <p>The secret to expanding the 'borders of your habitation', living a bigger, fuller life lies in your ability to access the tools to achieve your objectives. Access to credit allows you to capitalize or take advantage of:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Owning your dream car, home,</li>
    <li>Starting or expanding a business enterprise,</li>
    <li>Purchasing land,</li>
    <li>Shares or bonds etc.</li>
    </ol><br/>
    <p>However, credit is often times misunderstood and can seem mysterious in the way it works.&nbsp;For example, what is&nbsp;<strong>collateral</strong>&nbsp;and why it is important along with your&nbsp;<strong>credit rating</strong>&nbsp;to qualify for a loan?</p>
    <p><strong>Collateral</strong>&nbsp;is something pledged as security for repayment of a loan, to be surrendered in the event you can&rsquo;t repay during the period of the loan.</p>
    <p>Examples of collateral include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Cash in savings account or mutual fund</li>
    <li>Land or property</li>
    <li>Fixed Deposit</li>
    <li>Vehicles &ndash; less than 5 years old</li>
    <li>Gold</li>
    <li>Bonds and shares</li>
    </ul><br/>
    <p>Lenders rate customers when they lend money according to their reliability in repaying the monies lent. Banks, credit unions and financial lenders are responsible to recoup monies lent, to keep their companies&rsquo; profitable and successful in doing future business. If there are too many defaults on loans it could mean the end of that institution or instability over the short to medium term. Therefore, they vet and rate customers according to history of borrowing and repayment on time. If there is no history then a new customer has to create one with a credit card for example, to be rated on in the future. The higher the rating the lower the interest charged for borrowing.
