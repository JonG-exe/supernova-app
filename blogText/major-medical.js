    <p>Why Major Medical?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most health plans do not cover 100% of health care costs, especially the large bills.&nbsp; These can cripple an individual&rsquo;s savings goals and set you back for years.&nbsp; Being prepared to handle these costs is where AdMed covers up to $2M in Life and Critical Illness coverage and $700,000&nbsp; Surgical benefit. Even if you have surgery done at a public hospital the lump sum is still paid to you.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t need any original bills for this benefit, just proof it was done.</p>`
